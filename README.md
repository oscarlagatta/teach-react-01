# React Fundamentals Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the first project in our series designed to teach the fundamentals of React! This project aims to provide a practical, hands-on experience for learning React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Project Overview

In this initial project, you will start by learning the basic concepts of React, including components, state, and props. By the end of this project, you will have built a simple yet functional React application that showcases these fundamental concepts.

## Objectives

- Understand the basic architecture of a React application.
- Learn how to create functional components.
- Explore the handling of state and props in React.
- Develop a small project from scratch that you can expand in future modules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A text editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, WebStorm, etc...)

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies.

4. Start the development server. `npm run dev`


The application will run on `http://localhost:5173/` by default.

## Learning Modules

This project is broken down into several modules, each designed to cover a specific aspect of React. Here's what you can expect to learn in each module:

1. **Creating Components:** Learn how to build reusable components.
2. **Managing State:** Understand state management and how it affects the UI.
3. **Props in Action:** Learn how to pass data between components using props.
4. **Lifecycle Methods:** Explore the lifecycle of components in React.

## Upcoming Projects

This is just the beginning! Stay tuned for more projects in this series where you will delve deeper into advanced React topics and build more complex applications.
